### The goal was to learn new tools such as ReactJS and Bootstrap.
---
KiteSurfSkaneTwo include 5 pages, such as  Home,Shop,Courses,Item,Contacts.
I have used responsive design using Bootstrap grid (Col and
Row). 
I have also used the FormerMotion Library for animation on each
page. 
On the first page (#home) there is a carousel, image gallery, menu, which is visible to everyone
pages. 
There is also[ a button that can change the theme of the first page to
black and white.
On the other side (#shop) there is a built-in sidebar, carousel with items.
If you press an item, it opens in a new window.
On the third page (#kurser) comes a video with sound, accordion.
On the last page (#contacts) there is a form with validation that was built with
using Bootstap5.
In the Footer there is a wave animation.
